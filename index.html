Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's biggest economic hub, is home to the city of Ho
Chi Minh. It can be found on the banks of River Saigon at 60 km from
South China Ocean. The city is also located 1,760 kilometers south of
capital Hanoi. Ho Chi's rich cultural heritage and history has
attracted many tourists over the years. While some people travel to Ho
Chi as professionals, others come as students. It has a lively central
business district, surrounded small towns with a combined 9 million
residents.<br />

You want to feel instantly at home when you are there. It is unlikely
that you will feel at home in your hotel room. Most expats and
long-term business travelers prefer to rent space for their
accommodation. When signing a lease agreement, it is common to pay a 3
month deposit. In some cases, the tenant may ask for a six-month
payment in advance. Additional utilities, such as internet access,
garbage collection and cable TV, </big><big> </big><big> </big><big> <a href="https://vinhomesriversidehanoi.com/cho-thue-biet-thu-vinhomes-riverside/" target="_blank">cho thuê biệt thự Vinhomes Riverside</a></big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>may
be required in certain cases. There are many furnished homes available
throughout the city. However, they are usually designed to suit the
owner's tastes and preferences. It is possible to negotiate with
landlords for unfurnished homes to purchase furniture and property
tailored to your personal tastes. This decision will depend on the
length of your stay. Tap water is not suitable for drinking, but can be
used to clean dishes or brush teeth. Bottled water is available at your
doorstep, or you can buy it from local shops.<br />

The apartments for rent in Ho Chi Minh offer modern amenities such as
satellite television, internet access and a private balcony. Renters
can enjoy luxurious homes that are well-designed and provide great
comfort. A swimming pool, business center, and fitness room are some of
the other amenities available to tenants. Some apartments feature
living rooms equipped with plasma TVs, DVD players and leather sofa
sets. You can even cook your own meals in the kitchen. You can relax in
your en suite bathroom with its beautiful tubs. On request, management
can arrange for daily breakfast in your serviced apartment.<br />

A short distance from the airport are many good rental apartments. They
are great for travelers who need to travel across the country or in the
South-East Asian regions but don’t want to spend too much time driving
to the airport. You should consider accommodation that is pet-friendly
and has play areas that your children can enjoy if you are travelling
with your kids.<br />

Visitors are required to obtain a visa before entering Vietnam. This
visa is valid for 3 months and can be obtained at the Vietnam
international airport. If they are visiting Vietnam to work, foreigners
can obtain these documents from their sponsoring organisation. For a
3-3-6 month vocational visa, you will need to provide an assignment
letter and a passport. To ensure identification, visitors are required
to register their names immediately upon arriving in the city.<br />
